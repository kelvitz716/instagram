A Telegram bot that downloads content from Instagram posts, reels, and carousels using gallery-dl with Firefox cookies.

## Features

- Download Instagram posts (single image/video)
- Download Instagram reels
- Download Instagram carousels (multiple images/videos)
- Upload files to Telegram with progress tracking
- SQLite database for operation logging
- Browser cookie authentication (Firefox)
- Automatic file type detection
- Configurable upload methods (Bot API or Telethon)
- Smart retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Progress tracking for downloads and uploads
- Comprehensive error handling
- Rate limiting and flood control
- Configurable file watching
- Enhanced session management
- Docker support with health checks
- Easy deployment scripts

Note: Stories and highlights are not supported as they require Instagram's private API access.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Firefox browser (for Instagram authentication)
- Access to Telegram API (bot token, API ID, and API hash)

## Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kelvitz716/instagram.git
cd instagram
```

2. Set up your configuration:
```bash
# Copy example environment file
cp example.env .env

# Edit .env with your settings
nano .env  # or use any text editor
```

3. Add your Instagram cookies:
- Create or copy your `gallery-dl-cookies.txt` file into the project directory

4. Run the setup script:
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

That's it! The bot should now be running in a Docker container.

### Docker Commands

- View logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
- Stop the bot: `docker-compose down`
- Restart the bot: `docker-compose restart`
- Check status: `docker-compose ps`

### Docker Volumes

The bot uses Docker volumes to persist data:
- `./downloads`: Stores downloaded media files
- `gallery-dl-cookies.txt`: Instagram authentication cookies
- `.env`: Configuration file

## Manual Installation (Alternative)

If you prefer to run without Docker, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kelvitz716/instagram.git
cd instagram
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# or
myenv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Copy and configure environment variables:
```bash
cp example.env .env
# Edit .env with your settings
```

Required settings:
```env
BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
API_ID=your_telegram_api_id
API_HASH=your_telegram_api_hash
TARGET_CHAT_ID=your_target_chat_id
```

Optional settings (see example.env for all options):
```env
INSTAGRAM_USERNAME=your_instagram_username
FIREFOX_COOKIES_PATH=custom/path/to/cookies.sqlite
MAX_CONCURRENT_UPLOADS=3
BATCH_SIZE=10
FILE_WATCHER_ENABLED=true
```

5. Log in to Instagram in Firefox:
- Open Firefox
- Go to instagram.com
- Log in to your account
- Make sure to check "Remember me"

## Usage

1. Start the bot:
```bash
python bot.py
```

2. In Telegram, send commands to the bot:
- `/instagram <url>` - Download Instagram post, carousel, or reel
- `/login [username]` - Log in with Firefox cookies

## Docker Health Checks

The Docker container includes health checks that:
- Verify the bot's connection to Telegram
- Monitor the bot's operational status
- Automatically restart if issues are detected

Health check status can be viewed with:
```bash
docker inspect instagram-telegram-bot --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}'
```

## Architecture

The bot follows a service-based architecture:

```
instagram-bot/
├── src/                 # Source code
├── tests/              # Test files
├── Dockerfile          # Docker configuration
├── docker-compose.yml  # Docker Compose configuration
├── setup.sh           # Setup script
├── healthcheck.py     # Container health check
├── bot.py             # Entry point
└── requirements.txt   # Dependencies
```

## Configuration

See `example.env` for all available configuration options, including:
- Telegram settings
- Instagram options
- Upload configurations
- Database settings
- File watcher options
- Logging preferences
- Performance tuning

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Issues

1. Container won't start:
   - Check logs: `docker-compose logs`
   - Verify .env configuration
   - Ensure gallery-dl-cookies.txt exists

2. Health check failing:
   - Verify bot token is correct
   - Check Telegram API accessibility
   - Review logs for specific errors

3. Permission issues:
   - Ensure proper ownership of mounted volumes
   - Check file permissions in host directory

### Common Problems

1. Instagram authentication:
   - Verify cookie file is properly formatted
   - Check cookie file permissions
   - Ensure cookies are not expired

2. Network issues:
   - Check container networking
   - Verify proxy settings if used
   - Ensure required ports are accessible
